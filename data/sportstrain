im voting for @barrysanders for the madden 25 cover #madden25barry
...with them this morning, i was assessed a two-shot penalty. i understand and accept the penalty and respect the committees decision.
was that there was no violation, but  they had additional concerns based on my post-round interview. after discussing the situation...
i didnt know i had taken an incorrect drop prior to signing my scorecard. subsequently, i met with the masters committee saturday morning..
at hole #15, i took a drop that i thought was correct and in accordance with the rules. i was unaware at that time i had violated any rules.
i'm always trying to get better and that includes my app. #shortgame
thanks to mr. palmer for a great week, i got your back.
