we're the world's largest buyer of vaccines. in 2012 we procured almost 2bn doses, reaching 36% of worlds children. #vaccineswork
the unreached child is the most vulnerable - without access to education, health, protection and rights. #lastchild1st #vaccineswork
the economic costs of not vaccinating all children are staggering. #vaccineswork #lastchild1st
the unreached child needs vaccines, because they are more vulnerable to disease and lack access to treatment. #lastchild1st #vaccineswork
we're the world's largest buyer of vaccines. in 2012 we procured almost 2bn doses, reaching 36% of worlds children. #vaccineswork
