happen once in a century.

rossi: there's a lot of potential in education by 3d digitization of things like this:
holly little: there are fewer boundaries in university tracts in pursuit of digitization nowadays.
pyenson: objects can be slowly destroyed just through researchers' physical measurement. digital scans preserve integrity.
pyenson: open access to these types of digital data will create jobs.
pyenson: 3d is in its infancy, just like the internet was 15 years ago. but it's not a gimmick, at least for our needs.
nicholas pyenson (@pyensonlab): there is no guidebook for doing 3d scanning, especially in the chilean desert.
metallo: we want to set the curriculum free and let students and teachers find new ways to learn from our 3d objects.

@marisa_la_mejor here is more info on one of our projects:
@marisa_la_mejor we've worked a lot w/ @wikipedia so that our resources can be used to provide verified information to articles
@cdgautreaux wikipedia prefers if pages are edited by neutral 3rd parties, and since she is a former staffer we wouldn't be considered one
@junematics yes it is quite the honor! (and why we feel she deserves to be represented in wikipedia)
@staceysinger btw, here is more info about our earlier work to get our #womeninscience collection into wikipedia
@staceysinger not that we can tell. but there is room for multiple editors for the page. one of the wonders of crowd sourcing!

@noble_nike we don't have curators here today, but we do at our @amhistorymuseum @postalmuseum @airandspace and @freersackler
@miminuckols our @amhistorymuseum developed a crowdsourced app that records and plays descriptions of artifacts
@baysidescience6 we don't believe there is any indication that it will, but that's not something we are expert in!
@gulickgroup but we do at our @amhistorymuseum @airandspace @freersackler @nmafa and @postalmuseum
@gulickgroup it's actually not our day, it's an international effort. we don't have a curator on hand at this twitter...
@millerandsmith actually, curators are taking questions at our @amhistorymuseum @postalmuseum @airandspace @freersackler and @nmafa.
@bannedlibrary our @silibraries should be able to help you out with that. they're experts in rare books!
@bannedlibrary we don't appraise objects for monetary value, but here is how to display that awesome map

@baskcm we don't have a curator on hand today here, but we do at our @airandspace, @postalmuseum, @amhistorymuseum, @freersackler and @nmafa
@baysidescience6 we don't think we have an answer to that, but here's info on what we looked like when we first opened
@linseedoilart you might want to try asking one of our art museums like @americanart or its @lunder conservation lab
@museuciencies many are. we can't answer most of the subject matter questions without them!

@sarahpalenik the exhibition is under construction for its renovation, but you are still able to get a peak of the kitchen from one angle
here you go: first (very brief) video of the @nationalzoo's panda cub
@phoffheimer well you don't come up in our collections search, so unfortunately we have no idea!
@phoffheimer well we have 19 museums, 9 research centers, a zoo, magazines, etc. so if you could tell us which museum it would really help!
@phoffheimer is it in one of our museums? do you know which one?
and the @nationalzoo wants your help w/ #cubwatch. if you see the cub on the pandacam, tweet them a screen grab
and here's one of the first photos of the cub (the little white speck under mei xiang's chin)
weren't watching the @nationalzoo's pandacam last night? that's ok, the zoo just posted the video of the cub's birth
if you tune into our @nationalzoo's pandacam right now, you won't see the cub, but you'll hear lots of cub squawking!
.@nationalzoo panda staff and vets won't examine the cub for a few weeks, to give mom and baby a chance to bond. #cubwatch
our @nationalzoo is also tweeting updates as they have them. follow them or  #cubwatch
great news to wake up to this morning! our @nationalzoo has a panda cub!
rt @kellycrowwsj: which one of the @smithsonian's 19 museums is your all-time favorite? why? i'm listening!
robins are "like cheeseburgers" to mosquitoes. when they can't be found, we become dinner.

olympians @carmelitajeter and @justingatlin were at our @nationalzoo today to meet cheetahs named in their honor
@raenakimgeyer we asked an @amhistorymuseum curator too and she said she would guess it might have contained paraffin wax as well
@raenakimgeyer it was more about how the chocolate was processed. here is the history from hershey's archives
