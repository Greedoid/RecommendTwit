@crazyauditer which i wouldnt do. i have nothing but respect for pious devout believers in peace and holiness. i was on another issue
@crazyauditer i agree, and when the moment comes that we start gassing our own and suicide car-bombing rival sects, ill be the 1st to speak
@tortoiseeat once and for all i do not hate religion. just theocrats, autocrats or anyone who tells me what to think. i dont tell you
@crazyauditer should i ignore egypt, syria, iraq. the yemen. believe me i believe the west sucks too.
@crazyauditer wasnt my quote!!! i was opening debate by quoting someone else. surely you can read?
@crazyauditer that's saying not all. plus ironic use of charming does not imply universally abusers. or is free speech now dead?
@crazyauditer i didnt make any particular comment. just pointed to a website.. im no more an islamophobe than a christianophobe
@bigbadwolf50 just a tad! the cricket has calmed me down.

@stevenmurray4 not a thing
@dvddnh especially those raping monks 
@exposetweets wouldnt dream of it. the two are separate. i think judaism is pants too but anti-semitism worse
@yasqureshi no! there were twelve olympian gods for example. monotheism is new and the least unconvincing of them all
@katrinamaxwell or you can patronise me in any other number of self-satisfied ways. up to you.
@_flecky_ sorry i was too busy receiving an education. and why christ not mohammed, buddha or any other prophet/god?
@myoyumal well, a human who transcended and created a religion.  no big error there
@justvero happy for you.
good night all, havent meant to offend anyone (unlike some of you) - but please read, think, consider. a god would be an insult to man.

@dawncaddy nice
@exiledispatches i thought so too. but their eternal dumbness and aggressive stupidity cant go unchallenged
@cswaylander so agree - the twelve olympians are infinitely more convincing than allah and jehovah and all those bores.
@barrysnewman precisely - that is the proof that he is not an entity but a forlorn hope
@vincemorgia oh really? and you base this assertion on what evidence ?
@_myeung how could you possibly know that?
@mcjrhl thats an assertion not a fact
which is the 1 true sect worth killing others for? sunni, sufi, shiite, protestant, catholic, hindu, buddhist. lots will die in hell yes?
ok. so one god exists. is he zeus? ra? allah? yaweh? osiris? mars? minerva? buddha? they cant all be the one. call me back when you know
@robprovince i hope im or too. ive ever tortured, censored or killed someone for their belief. but its right  to be angry at those who do

@robbieamacleod read the article the - what @richarddawkins gets in hate mails and death threats is horrifying. atheists dont do that.
@fullgulaging if that made the slightest grammatical sense i might even believe you were literate.

@sloosh26 i don't suppose every athlete would perform this gesture of support, but enough to annoy putin. #sochisalute
russia confirms it will punish athletes who support lgbt rights at the olympics 
i recommend right hand to left shoulder, left hand to right shoulder and a bow. ask all athletes straight or gay to do this! #sochisalute
i am more and more convinced that if every athlete crossed their arms and bowed before their event and on the podium it would madden putin.
shocked by @freefromtorture expos of how torture survivors in the uk are pushed into #poverty -
@stephemurray sadly unfeasible: i think we should devise a simple kind of salute and bow of the head for every athlete to show support

just to be clear: if ann widdecombe was brian w, idve made the same (lame) joke. if she was anne smith idve been jokeless. that simple.
right im having a nap. its 6:33 here in la and im not called to the set till 10pm so probably wont wrap till 6am tomorrow.
@brain_opera ok sis! x
general view about the derivation of easter seems to be that it has nothing to do with ishtar, more with ostre an indo-european goddess
@brain_opera :-)
@supraphonic typo be damned. bullying? dont be an arse. go away. goodbye.
@brain_opera yes, sorry to have used delusional - but then as i have mental health issues too and u do know that joshing can be so good xx
@brain_opera we can certainly agree on that!
@brain_opera im sorry you saw it that way but if it was a guy called brian widdlecome idve made the same silly joke
.@brain_opera very happy to be childish and entirely refuse to grow up. but sexist?? thats just delusional im afraid.
@amandadquietone @iwannabeanelf yup, you made a complete arse of yourself (well your biog says you like sarcasm) x
anne widdlecum may be stupid enough to watch/read me but i shan't be so idiotic as to waste time on her victimhood and passive aggression
@ruffianxion that's ok, you sly beast! ;-)
.@thepopeinrome @bbc she's really not worth it. she provides the satire herself. perhaps she's the naughty creation of a naughty atheist?

it's one thing to feel that you are on the right path, but it's another to think that yours is the only path
la felicidad es algo que cuando se divide, se multiplica
love is what makes you smile when you are tired

nacimos para cometer errores, no para fingir ser personas perfectas
we love because love sets us free, and we say things that we once never even had the courage to whisper to ourselves.
deus escuta as preces daqueles q pedem para esquecer o odio. mas fica surdo aos que querem fugir do amor
@teslasalgado saludos y excelente final de semana
el amor no necesita ser entendido. slo necesita ser demostrado
amamos porque o amor nos liberta e nos d coragem

hopeful in evil times and cautious / in good, ready for weal or woe, / be prepared. ~horace
do not inquire, we may not know, what end / the god's will give... ~horace
