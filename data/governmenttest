my condolences to former speaker tom foley's family and friends. he was a distinguished public servant who will be greatly missed.
.@drshow it was wonderful talking with you, diane! now that #shutdown is past, we need to step up and come together.
welcome back to work to all of our federal employees. thank you for your service to our country.
i applaud the senate for coming together in the spirit of bipartisanship and urge my colleagues in the house to follow their example.
diana nyad: example of true grit, perseverance and inspiring approach to life. amazing to meet, talk w/ her last night!
why i wrote for the next generation: we cant be more invested in politics of today than in securing a stable tmrw:
never in my time as a public servant have i seen such a callous display of political brinkmanship.
proud to be in nj working to elect an all star ticket! #njgov
.@stefcutter in all the #shutdown tumult, havent had a chance to wish you #mazeltov on your baby-to-be! so happy for you!! #momsrock
the choice in the #njsen race: @corybooker who will seek compromise or his opponent who will make what's wrong with washington worse.
this is hateful, discriminatory and just plain wrong. bauer should be ashamed. sandra fluke and all women deserve better.
.@corybooker, so sorry to hear about your loss. the entire dem family is thinking of you.
more than a week into the reckless #gopshutdown and republicans still won't listen to the majority of americans.
r's said they wanted a rebrand. what have they done instead? held our economy hostage over their extreme agenda:
on november 5, the people of nj should choose @buonofornjgov to lead the comeback that @chrischristie never did. #njgov
a reminder of what's happening &gt; gop has shut down the government and are threatening default because they refuse to accept #aca is law.
it's time for @johnboehner to do his job and listen to the american people. add your voice:
.@johnboehner claims there aren't enough votes to pass a clean funding bill. this shows otherwise &gt;
.@ron_fournier awesome. good luck @abby4nier! #ourkidscomefirst
go wendy go! rt @wendydavistexas: i'm in it. for texas. #teamwendy
thankful that all fl23 congressional staff and dnc staff safe. praying for everyone's safety. please heed lockdown instructions. #staysafe
.@chucktodd, thanks for having me on the show. here's the tweet i sent yesterday to @reince:
.@reince still waiting for a reply. will you join the majority of congress and americans to support a clean funding bill to reopen the gov?
10 million americans visited the #obamacare health exchange yesterday seeking information. this is what republicans are trying to take away.
as a breast cancer survivor, this month's special for me. together, let's promote greater understanding and find a cure. #bcsm
disappointed by the gross irresponsibility of my republican colleagues. no more political posturing! #gopshutdown
the #gopshutdown is all in the name of denying people #obamacare. good thing it's law and already up and running:
remember when john boehner called a government shutdown "irresponsible?" 
"wonderful" "excited" "people will be very grateful"&gt; actual statements from r's on the #gopshutdown:
thanks to my awesome staff, family, friends, colleagues and tweeps for making my #birthday special yesterday!
thanks to @zoepagonis, @womenspolicyinc and @repterrisewell staff and interns for the #birthday wishes! #partylikeim47 #cuziam!
5 days until the exchange opens! retweet and share this site:
clear take away from tonight's #vagovdebate. @terrymcauliffe is the only candidate with the commonsense agenda to grow va's economy.
officials in miami-dade get it  #obamacare is not a partisan issue, it's a law that needs to be implemented:
beautiful day in montana visiting with fellow democrats. we're on a mission to #expandthemap!
floridians and all americans deserve information about their health care options. @flgovscott, get out of the way!
the gop plan to shutdown the government and default on our nation's obligations will cost us billions:
former gop senator judd gregg is right: the gop's reckless behavior is bad for america.
the headlines say it all:
thanks to @mitchellreports for hosting me. it's time for r's to set rigid ideology aside and stop threatening our economic security.
for the next generation is out next month! excited to share my ideas and hear from you on how we can make the country better. #dwsnextgen
note to my gop colleagues &gt; our nation's economic stability is not a bargaining chip!
republicans need to stop holding our nation's economic stability hostage. it's bad for our country:
as we celebrate #constitutionday, let us rededicate ourselves to protecting one of its key principles  the right to vote.
#navyyard's filled with people who have committed their lives to protecting our freedom. we thank them and stand with them during this time
for the next generation: we need to engage americans on policy issues so they understand their stake in the political process. #dwsnextgen
since #vawa's signing, fewer people are suffering from domestic violence. but there's still more we can do:
.@scottgessler @thedemocrats @politico says guy who vehemently opposed co bill expanding voters' access to the polls.
.@corybooker's an effective mayor who will make a great senator! (and he runs into burning buildings!) join him:
even with the #corecall, the gun violence prevention law still stands and dems will continue to fight to make our communities safer.
the #corecall was defined by the many obstacles that special interests threw in the way of voters to reverse the will of the people.
.@benjealous has been a champion of freedom and equality and i wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.
yet another reason why #obamacare matters. #thisisobamacare
fun-filled day @novase 'a day for children' in davie. health assessments, games, @miamiheat's james jones and more. 
.@moelleithee @thedemocrats yeah, see attached for preview of outcome of game tomorrow.
when the sun sets today we'll begin the celebration of rosh hashanah  a time to reflect on the past and look towards the future.
the election in colorado is too important to sit out. if you live there, get involved today. it's a week away:
labor day's an opportunity to honor those whose hard work is an expression of patriotism and a demonstration of devotion to their families.
re syria: i urge both parties to put partisan politics aside and consider this important issue with the seriousness that it demands.
40 wasteful votes to repeal #obamacare and now more talk about defaulting on our obligations. speaker boehner, enough!

.@kyrstensinema thanks so much! she was so excited this a.m., she woke up at 5:15 and was already halfway ready when i came in to wake her!
just dropped my twins off for their 1st day of high school. my gosh, didn't i just drop them off at pre-k? #bittersweet #timeflies #proudmom
as democrats work to become more inclusive, republicans won't even talk about it:
even top republicans acknowledge that their party has a problem: 
great (bi-partisan) read on the need to fix our broken immigration system:
#immigrationreform will grow our economy and create jobs. what are republicans waiting for? let's vote!
the people of colorado should decide their electorate, not extreme national groups &gt; 
another day, another republican effort to restrict voting rights:
this video proves it. the gop is controlled by extreme factions in their party:
how about this for #tbt? my high school graduation photo...#onceacurlygirlalwaysacurlygirl
the gop's having a hard time attracting female candidates. with their policy stance on limiting women's rights, is anyone really surprised?
100 years ago, i wouldn't have had the right to vote. we've come a long way, but there's more work to do &gt;
.@rlkaminski you are so welcome! happy birthday! hope to see you in az in a few weeks at @thedemocrats mtg.
breath of fresh air &gt; the republican case for supporting pres. obama's climate change plan:
this is a disgrace to the legislative process as well as a waste of time and taxpayer dollars:
happy birthday to @massgovernor deval patrick. you're a great leader for massachusetts and our country.
exactly rt @senatorreid: democrats wont agree to any plan that balances the budget by killing jobs and whacking the middle class.
rt @nancypelosi: meet the #repealicans: 40 votes to repeal health care reform, 0 votes to create jobs.
it's extremely rare that i agree with rep. king but he's right: shutting down the government is a terrible idea:
#ada was a major accomplishment but there's still much more to do to ensure full equality for americans living with disabilities.
so great to meet @wendydavistexas! as democrats, we're ready to fight back and #standwithwomen.
republicans are right  #speechesdonthire. the plan president obama has laid out for our economy  that will. #abetterbargain
these types of comments are offensive and add nothing to the conversation. rep. king should be ashamed:
military sex assault victims were silenced in congress.lend your voice, support #mjia for their fair shot at justice
.@terrymcauliffe was the clear winner in today's #vbadebate. he's the only candidate who'll fight for va's middle-class families.
#ff to @wendydavistexas. thanks for your advocacy and work. you're an inspiration. #standwithwomen.

ohio knows: if mitt romney wins, the middle class loses.
my takeaway: mitt romney offered no specifics other than doubling down on the failed policies of the past.
rt @thedemocrats: this is mitt romney's idea of a health plan:
rt @barackobama: cheer on president obama in good company tonight. find a debate watch party near you:
when you're running for president and the stakes are so high, facts and specifics matter. so far the romney campaign has been light on both.

.@mittromney wanted @barackobama to succeed? so why'd he say "we have to remember what this election is really about:defeating @barackobama"
turns out mitt romney had a whole lot of helpin the form of a federal bailoutin building his business.
mitt romney and paul ryan want to shrink governmentunless, of course, you're a woman.
not much to say about their candidate/mt@elcanalednc: theme of night was "2016" speakers spoke about themselves not candidate @mittromney
let's do it again next wk! enjoyed it! /mt@teambrewer: great debate w/ @dwstweets on #meetthepress #gopconvention

@donnaorender thank you! the feeling is mutual! proud to have met a true champion for women and a trailblazer in women's sports!
as romney campaigns in fl, he must answer questions about his involvement in damon corp.'s medicare fraud. memo:
we know romney will say anything to get electedbut tonight was truly a breathtaking display of dishonesty.
romney's wrong. president believes peace must come between israel and palestine through direct negotiation between the two. #cnndebate
romney's just pandering to fl on nasa. he said it should be a priority but his budget would make huge cuts to it.
@mittromney-would be most extreme presidential nominee we've seen. would veto dream act. says 1 thing in fl & opposite in sc. #thetruthhurts
