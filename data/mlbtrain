6 innings in the books on @mlb_tbs. @michaelwacha returns to the bump against the heart of the @dodgers order. #nlcs
9-0. @cardinals can taste the #worldseries now.
thats all for clayton kershaw, who departs with #dodgers trailing 5-0, 2 on and 0 out in the 5th on @mlb_tbs.
it's the #postseason. @carlosbeltran15 does what he wants. #vintage
carlos beltran, because its october:
.@michaelwacha is dealing and this place is completely out of control. #nlcs
clayton kershaw allowed 4 earned runs in the 3rd inning. he allowed one  total  in his previous 5 starts. #nlcs
the @cardinals are blowing the roof off this place. @sugashane43 drives in two more and it's 4-0 through 3 on @mlb_tbs. #nlcs
make it 2-0 @cardinals. yadier molina drives in beltran and busch stadium has gotten quite loud. #nlcs

max scherzer is third @tigers hurler in past 3 #postseason games to fan at least 10 and allow no more than 2 hits:
some things never change:
salty's here, and he's in effect:
before the @redsox capped an improbable comeback, @max_scherzer turned in an outstanding 13-k outing:
the @redsox are back on track after a ridiculous come-from-behind win in #alcs game 2:
how close was torii hunter to catching @davidortiz's grand slam? this close:
"if i tell you i was thinking of hitting a grand slam i'd be lying." - big papi:
add some salty and we have ourselves an alcs:
we're going to play to the final out. david so many times has come up big, [but] none bigger than tonight.  farrell on ortiz
he loves it when you call him big papi:
"against benoit, i felt something good was gonna happen. everyone thought something good was gonna happen." - salty
elite company: salty is 1st @redsox catcher since carlton fisk to record a #walkoff hit in the #postseason.
unforgettable. @tmobile #unleash

.@anibalsanchez19. unhittable:
before tonight, the @redsox had not been shut out at home in the #postseason since game 5 of the 1918 #worldseries against the cubs.
all the @tigers needed was one run to take them home:
5 @tigers pitchers combined for a one-hitter in game 1. this was that hit:
classic pitching duels. no-hit drama. two 1-0 games for 1st time in #postseason history. this is october. welcome to the show.
the @tigers 17 strikeouts match #postseason record set by bob gibson in 1968 #worldseries.
what a ride! no history, but anibal and co. steal game 1 at fenway:
this was nearly the first combined no-hitter, first lcs no-hitter and first no-no thrown by visiting team in #postseason history. #alcs
so close! daniel nava breaks up @tigers combined no-hit bid with 1-out bloop single off joaquin benoit in 9th.
strikeout. one down. #alcs on @mlbonfox.
three outs away! @tigers have a combined no-hitter through eight on @mlbonfox:
jose veras strikes out first 2 @redsox batters in 8th; drew smyly enters to face @davidortiz on @mlbonfox. #alcs

the @tigers have the first run of the #alcs. jhonny peralta singles home @miguelcabrera for 1-0 lead in 6th.
through 5: @anibalsanchez19 has allowed 0 hits and struck out 10 on 88 pitches. @tigers 0, @redsox 0 on @mlbonfox. #alcs
this is your reminder that anibal sanchez already struck out 17 in game once this season. @tmobile #unleash
four in the books on @mlbonfox. @anibalsanchez19 has 9 ks without giving up a hit. #alcs
.@michaelwacha has thrown 14 innings this #postseason and given up 1 run. he is 22 years old:
anibal sanchez through 2 innings: 0 hits, 3 walks, 5 ks, 51 pitches. @tigers and @redsox are scoreless on @mlbonfox. #alcs
