@tom_rodrigues education can unlock development on many fronts, but other reforms must follow: labor laws, business environment, etc
@marrionette90 most dont have the chance due to poverty, cost, access or gender discrimination. conflict forces others to drop out.
@dennisbloeme sub-saharan africa alone contains half of the worlds out of school children. another quarter are in s & w asia.

best outcome for me while in napa valley (in addition to  uncontrollable culinary indulgence) was connecting w/ daughter, iman.
by the way, for all you perplexed parents out there, summer hols can be great for deciphering teenage language code.
it hasnt all been relaxation though. ive been keeping up to date with progress in global efforts to get every child into school.
had a great time with the family. kids just love the summer holidays, but who doesnt like nearly two months off!
well, its been a glorious summer. disconnecting yourself from the world is true freedom. i recommend it every once in a while!

isso significa que a partir do prximo ano as pequenas e micro empresas podero ser abertas em no mximo 5 dias!
mas temos q avanar mais. temos q enfrentar a burocracia, q asfixia tantas pequenas e micro empresas.
nosso governo realizou 7 milhes de operaes de crditos para 3,5 milhes de pequenos empreendedores, injetando r$ 9 bi no mercado.

o brasil tem uma economia slida e, por isso, tem recebido investimentos externos vultuosos, como comprova o  leilo de libra.

.@xavierdominguez @freddybalsera @serranopv great to be w/ you too! excited about your vision.
thanks again @booktv for having me on to discuss my book, for the next generation! watch the interview here:
with the hobby lobby vs. sebelius case, i fully expect scotus to side with the american people.
republicans want to repeal #obamacare = they want to return to a time when insurance companies could discriminate against women.
despite the website glitches, millions of americans are already feeling the positive effects of #obamacare &gt;
thanks to @booktv for having me on to discuss my book, for the next generation. love the show and always enjoy taking viewer qs. #mbfi30

.@marcorubio, the #gopshutdown cost us $24b and did nothing but hurt our constituents. you really want another?
happy birthday @vp biden! had a great time with you in panama talking about port expansion. enjoy your day.
40 years after roe v. wade, it's a shame we must continue to fend off attempts to curb access to health care for women. #respectabqwomen
the #abq vote and its outcome is yet another reminder that we must remain vigilant and engaged, never taking our rights for granted.
the rejection of an extreme abortion ban by voters in #abq is a victory for the right of women to make their own health-care decisions.
today's albuquerque vote isn't a minor inconvenience. it takes away women's fundamental right to choose what's best for them. #stoptheban

can't believe "catch an illegal immigrant" is being held in the 1st place let alone led by an abbott staffer.

amazing. rt @sfwish: you've saved her, #sfbatkid! the citizens of gotham thank you!!!!
the president and democrats are willing and eager to work with anyone to ensure that the affordable care act works for everyone.
democrats know the american people have and will continue to reject the gops gut and repeal approach to #obamacare.
an image for our daughters. they can achieve anything they dream: fed chair, supreme ct, potus. #girlpower #nuffsaid
happy birthday @chairmanbuckley! thanks for your leadership of @demchairs and great work for the people of new hampshire.
.@reince says the gop is "fresh and new." restricting women's health is #notfreshnotnew, it's the same old gop:
was just on @cnn talking #obamacare. its time for republicans to stop obstructing the law and confusing consumers.
the #vaag race came down to 163 votes proving once again that every vote matters. #blueva
love this &gt; for the first time in more than 40 years, democrats will hold all statewide offices in virginia. #vaag #blueva

between illinois legalizing same-sex marriage and the senate passing #enda, it was a good week for #equality in america.
i still can't believe my gop colleagues think food stamp cuts are ok. letting kids go hungry isn't a budget solution.
today's jobs report is a positive sign but imagine how much better it could have been if it weren't for the reckless #gopshutdown.
huge thanks to @thedemocrats and state party staffers for hard work, kick a-- organizing on #dem wins tuesday! #technicalterm #canihearanamen?
.@dbetras @billmaher @hbo thanks to a great chairman and friend!
cancer survivors know how critical #obamacare is. watch this nebraskan's story:
thrilled with my colleagues in the senate. now it's our turn. do what's right @johnboehner. give us a vote to #passenda!
.@flgovscott is preventing nearly 1 million uninsured floridians from getting covered. what a disgrace. time to put #peopleoverpolitics.

today, the senate is voting to #passenda. retweet if you think it's time to end discrimination!
can't thank @thedemocrats interim ed laura santucci enough. @billdeblasio and all of nyc will be lucky to have her working for them.
want to know what happened last night and what it means for elections moving forward? read this &gt;
thanks to @chucktodd for having me. in election after election, voters are saying no to tea party extremism.
if there is one thing that's clear tonight, its that 2013 was a great year to run as a democrat.
atlanta made a great choice today in reelecting @kasimreed. he's a strong leader who fights for middle-class families. congrats mayor!

i'm so tired of the tea party and their reckless behavior in congress. if you are too, help dems win back the house:
.@victoriaellend began to close when #aca passed. seniors get 50% cut on brand name prescription drugs in donut hole. fully closes by 2020.
my thoughts are with everyone affected by the horrific events at lax.
as someone with a pre-existing condition, i know the peace of mind that comes with health care coverage.
#ff to @thedemocrats new ceo, @amykdacey! amy will be instrumental in helping us win in 2014, 2016 and beyond.
.@repjoegarcia thanks so much, my friend!
congress must improve our nations education system. more from my book, for the next generation, on @huffingtonpost:

proud to announce ive asked @amykdacey to join us as ceo of @thedemocrats! a seasoned, talented leader who will help #dems continue to win!
i couldn't be happier to welcome @amykdacey as the new ceo for @thedemocrats! shell be an invaluable asset to democrats all over america.
wow, you've got to watch this 12-year-old chastises nc republicans on their efforts to restrict #votingrights:
it's easy to see how extreme @kencuccinelli really is. just read his own words --&gt;
republicans saying they want to help while at the same time blocking navigators = the ultimate hypocrisy.
thanks again to @thedailyshow for having me on! had a great time talking about my new book, for the next generation.
.@ambdermer honored to be 1st official mtg in congress. dermer public service tradition continues. #sofla proud of our #nativeson! #mazeltov
.@cottonnews that is so cool!! gotta reach people to raise #breastcancerawareness any way we can! thanks for sharing! #cotton
stopped by the dnc's #breastcancerawareness event. glad to see so many colleagues there. as a survivor, i know early detection is critical.
is anyone even the least bit surprised that women support @terrymcauliffe over @kencuccinelli by double digits?
even @wendydavistexas was affected by texas's new strict voter id laws &gt;
8 days left in the #vagov race and this is what @kencuccinelli is talking about? wow.
the @gop thinks their words "hurt themselves" with women voters. in reality, its their polices that hurt women.
in 2012, we saw the largest gender gap in history for pres. obama. we need to keep it up. &gt;
yes!/mt @eleanorslegacy: @dwstweets: ny women getting in the game! we endorsed 122 #progressive women in 29 counties
had a great weekend at the @fladems convention. #wearefl and it's time to elect more dems who will fight for fl's families!
between restricting womens health, shutting down the government and risking default, the gop keeps getting worse:
.@glamourmags commitment to raising breast cancer awareness in young women so important. young women can and do get #breastcancer. #thankyou
my advice to young women &gt; never blow off your health.
.@ananavarro sighing along w/ you, my friend. #beenthere

remember this? gop rep. barton: "this is a huge undertaking and there are going to be glitches." #tbt
it's time to move past shutdowns and default crises and focus on important things like #immigrationreform.
voter education and protection are core to @thedemocrats mission. we're thrilled to welcome pratt wiley to our team.
virginia women deserve a governor who will fight for them, not one who will try to take away their rights.
.@sentedcruz, jeopardizing our nation's economic security and threatening default isn't a "victory." it's a disgrace.
.@socialrixys #happybirthday to a great mom, an amazing advocate and a wonderful friend! #girlpower #wellbehavedwomenrarelymakehistory
i know firsthand how important it is to get regular checkups. #obamacare makes them more accessible. watch:

just three weeks in and already nearly 500,000 americans have applied for #obamacare. what great news!
yesterday, marco rubio said he wasn't in favor of a shutdown. thats completely false &gt;
gop poll tested soundbite to soften image on opposing gay rights. how about: stop the hate, embrace equality for all?
.@katieharbath this was an awesome platform to interact w/ people on my facebook page after my book presentation and signing tonight. thanks!
.@marcytanter @bpicampus @huffpostparents kids need ground rules for social media. our rule is no accepting friends who you dont know.

.@hilaryr @popsugar thanks! it was great talking to them. my girls will think im extremely cool now!
.@tb_times on the message voters sent by electing amanda murphy  first dem to hold the seat in 15 yrs.
.@potuspresspool it was a pleasure talking w/ julie and students in the audience! i hope people enjoy for the next generation. #dwsnextgen
record low turnout due to an arbitrary, costly election day. another example of christie's failed leadership:
it's unfathomable that republicans are already saying they want to try to hold our economy hostage again.
looking forward to joining @bpshow this morning at 7:30 - tune in here
congratulations @corybooker! you're going to make an excellent senator!
thankful this reckless, irresponsible #gopshutdown is over. now, let's move on and focus on actually governing.
glad senate democrats and republicans found compromise. hopeful we'll be able to do the same in the house. #endthisnow
if you live in new jersey, make sure to go out and vote for @corybooker today!
.@norahodonnell @davidagus @cbsthismorning with brca2 i made life-altering decisions based on 1 test, no 2nd opinion allowed, this was huge.
tonight's #njgov debate offered yet another reminder that the people of nj aren't being served well by gov christie.
a huge congrats to @voteamanda on her victory tonight and big thanks to @fladems for their support. amanda, can't wait to work with you!
a very scary, real warning from fitch. hoping @johnboehner pays attention to this:
check out @huffpostlive now for my thoughts on the #shutdown and details on my new book, for the next generation:
republicans need to stop listening to the tea party and start listening to the american people.

on @morning_joe today they listed the top 10 politicians we need right now. here are a few women they left out:
.@repjoegarcia thank you so much, my friend. #breastcancer #thinkpink
.@messina2012 trust me, you won't look good in purple! #gogators #beatlsu
.@j9marier as a mom and someone w/ a pre-existing condition, i feel for mason. gop needs to stop opposing #obamacare.
.@corybooker has the backing of middle-class new jerseyans. who does steve lonegan have? tea party idol sarah palin!
actions have consequences. new poll reveals the republican party's favorability is at an all time low.
rt @thedemocrats: breaking: president obama just made history by nominating janet yellen for federal reserve chair.
what a great choice by the president! congrats to janet yellen on being nominated for federal reserve chair. #womenrule
if democrats had the majority in the house, this reckless #gopshutdown would never have happened. help take it back:
.@douginflorida b/c fla. voters smarter than @flgovscott gives them credit for. see thru his voter purge for what it is: #votersuppression
it's simple &gt; we have to be responsible, we have to pay the bills and we have to get the government up and running. #letsvote
not that bad? it'd be catastrophic &gt; "many in g.o.p. offer theory: default wouldnt be that bad"
tonight @buonofornjgov called attention to the contradictions between christies campaign and the reality of his failed record as governor.
good luck to my friend @buonofornjgov in tonight's #njgov debate! tune in here:
we have to pay our bills, keep the government functioning and make sure everyone has access to affordable, quality health care. #justvote
thx, @mitchellreports for having me. it's time to stop pitting priorities against one another. let's #justvote and fund the entire government.
a plea from a  26-year-old with crohn's disease asking republicans to stop their crusade against #obamacare.
hoping john boehner starts listening to the majority of congress and ends the #gopshutdown. enough pandering to the tea party already!
the #gopshutdown is bad but a default on our nation's obligations would be catastrophic. #enoughalready #justvote #dontdefault
why won't @johnboehner call a vote? because he's afraid of challenging the most extreme voices in his caucus. #justvote
read this &gt; "governing by blackmail"
the #gopshutdown is hitting home for @johnboehner and it's not good. hoping he watches this and finally calls a vote &gt;
what world does @johnboehner live in? we have the votes to pass a clean funding bill. why is he denying that? #justvote
i wish this were a joke. here's @sentedcruz's (aka the gop's new leader) idea of "compromise."
dont let republicans like rick scott keep you from getting info about #obamacare. follow @healthcaregov today. #ff
it's been a long week. but despite the gop's reckless shutdown, there's been some good news too.
i agree 100% with rep. dingell and former gop senator dole. the best way to honor our vets is to fully fund our gov:
we're 4 days into the #gopshutdown. it could end at any moment. we just need boehner to get some courage and call a vote!
thank you to the capitol police and all of our first responders for working so quickly to keep us all safe. hoping everyone's okay.
.@reince hope all @gop are ok too. agree completely. thanks for working w/ us to put politics aside as we all focus on keeping people safe.
.@reince look forward to joining you on @crossfirecnn. here's some light reading for you in advance:
.@flgovscott doesn't deserve a 2nd term. his latest voter purge is a disgrace and we will fight back. #votingrightsmatter
in 15 minutes the house could convene and we could reopen the government. what's the hold up? john boehner.
.@thedemocrats was proud to join @chci for the #chci awards gala tonight!
we have the votes to end the #gopshutdown. all we need now is john boehner to find some courage and give us the chance to vote.
.@reince i'm proud of my avatar! #obamacare helps people like me (a cancer survivor) and kids like violet #getcovered.
.@reince, i agree. the gop should never have closed down the government and wwii memorial. we have the votes to reopen both. will you support?
joined to #demandavote from boehner. majority of congress and americans agree. time to pass a clean funding bill.
how's open enrollment going in the states? take a look at the local coverage:
a reminder of what happened yesterday  @thedemocrats expanded health care and the @gop shut down the government. #priorities
the exchange has been open for less than a day but already thousands have signed up!
apx. 200 patients, incl 30 kids, most with cancer, will be turned away from nih clinical trials b/c of #gopshutdown
embarrassed to see my colleague from florida downplaying the effects of the #gopshutdown.
it's ironic the republicans shut down the government at the exact moment
was just asked on @mitchellreports what we'd like to see from republicans. it's simple. a clean funding bill and no more games. #gopshutdown
$10 billion in costs to the economy per week and this is what r's had to say!? #gopshutdown
upset about the #gopshutdown? take action. do exactly what the gop tried to prevent. share info about
help get out the word about the #obamacare health care exchange. join me and change your avatar to this. #getcovered
because extremists have been able to run the republican party, we're now shutdown and jeopardizing our economy. #gopshutdown
a #gopshutdown would cost our economy billions of dollars. #enoughalready
open enrollment starts tomorrow! here's how #obamacare is already working for floridians:
#obamacare makes sure cancer survivors like me can't be denied coverage. the gop wants to take that protection away. #gopshutdown
wow. just wow. rt @thedemocrats: as the #gopshutdown looms, here's what some house republicans have to say.
regardless of what happens at midnight, the exchange opens tomorrow. learn more:
welcome to @thedemocrats new digital director @mattcompton. as dems, we're committed to building our digital advantage. #expandthemap
less than a day until the #gopshutdown. hoping my republican colleagues come to their senses. #enoughalready #newday
thanks to @crowleycnn for having me. the gop must abandon their shutdown strategy. #enoughalready #gopshutdown
you have to check out this new site from @thedemocrats:
.@flgovscott, take a cue from gov. beshear and get out of the way. floridians need #obamacare:
having major governor envy. wish rick scott had even half the leadership skills of steve beshear.
engaging americans on major issues facing us and our kids. my book, for the next generation, discusses.
this is one of the many protections republicans are trying to take away. fight back:
wow. so this is how republicans feel about voter turnout. #provethemwrong
the republicans led by the tea party have set us on a dangerous path that will threaten the health of our economy. #enoughalready
thanks to @jansingco for having me on the show. the gop needs to stop their reckless political games and get back to work.
instead of putting forward a plan to grow va's economy, @kencuccinelli doubled down on his extreme ideology.
good luck to @terrymcauliffe in tonight's #vagovdebate! you can watch it here:
good luck to @terrymcauliffe in tonight's #vagovdebate! you can watch it here:
hoping other counties follow broward's lead. floridians deserve information about their health care options:
.@sentedcruz, will you mention the lower than expected #obamacare premiums during your #fauxlibuster?
.@morningmika women need to give ourselves permission not to be perfect. prioritize, know what's most important, don't sweat small stuff.
my book, for the next generation: a policy breakdown based on whats best for our kids. preorder here:
#obamacare ends lifetime caps and protects families from going bankrupt if they get sick. this is what cruz wants to take away. #fauxlibuster
why are republicans desperately trying to stop #obamacare? because they know it'll work and americans will like it.
the more people vote, the more our government is truly "of the people, by the people, for the people." register now:
.@kristin_jacobs, good luck on the vote today. thanks for standing up for florida's uninsured!
.@flgovscott, time to stop the games with navigators. take a cue from broward and pinellas counties.
this is who @kencuccinelli is running with in virginia &gt;
welcome to twitter secretary @madeleine! thanks for your friendship, leadership and support. you continue to be an inspiration.
it's time for republicans to find a path toward the center, toward compromise.
hoping all of my republican colleagues read this &gt; "most oppose defunding effort."
couldn't agree more &gt; it seems insane to shut down the federal government to prevent an expansion of health care."
must-read editorial on the republicans reckless behavior: "once more to the brink."
make sure to preorder your copy of my new book, for the next generation:
.@robinroberts, congratulations! each year gets easier, promise.
should be required reading for every republican &gt; "i'm a 35-year-old veteran on food stamps."
republicans wanted to let the auto industry fail. here's why elections matter. #thanksobama
republicans just forced us to vote for the 42nd time to gut #obamacare. #headdesk
the #gopcivilwar is over and the tea party's won.
my republican colleagues should be ashamed. do they really think it's a good idea to cut #snap to low-income kids and vets?
not only is he a great senator but the man can spell! congrats @timkaine!
for years republicans have manufactured crises. the victim? our economy:
default and shutting down the government &gt; two terrible options that will hurt americans.
thanks to #cbcfalc13 for having me today. together, we're going to keep fighting for equality, fairness and opportunity for everyone.

what women inspire you?
gabby inspires me, makes me laugh  and seeing her become an inspiration to the world warms my heart.
i was asked to write an essay about who inspires me. here's my story about my good friend, @gabbygiffords:
rt @chucktodd: on the @dailyrundown today: @senbobcorker and @dwstweets. will be talking lots of syria as well as gun politics.
i wrote for the next generation b/c our kids need us to prioritize long term solutions. pre-order:
.@flgovscott, #obamacare's law. time to end the political theatrics and work on implementation, not more obstruction.
despite the nra's efforts, the co recall results will do nothing to change the democratic control of the co house, sen. and govs office.
co's low turnout was a result of efforts by the nra, koch brothers and other right wing groups who know that when more people vote, dems win.
rt @thedemocrats: .@dwstweets on the colorado recall election: "this was voter suppression, pure and simple."
12 years later, let us mourn those we lost, pay tribute to the bravery of our 1st responders and never forget how our nation came together.
pick up the phone now and call anyone you know that lives in el paso or pueblo county co and remind them to vote no. polls close at 7pm mt.
happy birthday to my wonderful husband, steve who is also a phenomenal dad! love you so much. 
if you live in nyc, make sure to vote in today's primary. more info here:

today, let's rededicate ourselves to the cause of progress on behalf of our nations workers, beginning with raising the minimum wage.
broward @aflcio #labor ball in hollywood. thank you for standing up for the working men and women of our community.
president obama has demonstrated a clear willingness to engage members of congress about how to respond to the tactics of the assad regime.
rt @thedemocrats: statement from @dwstweets on president obama's announcement today regarding syria:
this is a great step forward in reducing gun violence and making our communities safer. thanks president obama:

as #democrats, we're determined to plant a flag in every corner of the country!
just when you thought @kencuccinelli's policies toward women couldnt get any worse
laws that make voting harder are a blemish on our democracy, a wound that should not be left to fester.

@thatguyusa yes, you can sign up for federal-run exchange in florida beginning on oct. 1st.
what despicable comments. i can't believe this man is running for elected office.
.@flgovscott, you had the opp to manage fl's exchange and forfeited the right. stop standing in the way of progress:

.@ktumulty know how u feel. cried just like on their very first day of school, which they predicted! but they dutifully posed for a picture.
check this out: "a republican conversion to obamacare."
in november, americans had a choice of two paths; they chose president obama and @thedemocrats path:
today as we remember all of the brave women who fought for the right to vote, let us redouble our efforts to protect what they fought for.
.@suedvorsky told none-too-pleased shelby we wouldn't make it this yr! promised jake he can go 2! as we say, #nextyeariniowa! #onastick

.@dbetras @bzoldan @timryan @erikpolitx @odpchairman/ looking forward to coming back! #valleystrongvalleyproud

.@moelleithee @shearm that was me and one of 17k of my closest @gop friends at the #iowastrawpoll! cc: @woodhouseb @melanieathud
not only are his policies extreme, @kencuccinelli's shrouded in controversy:
first it was rick scott. now, pat mccrory is jumping on the gop voter suppression bandwagon:
this is such a great program! if you're interested in public service, apply today:
local elections are supposed to be about the people in the district, not extreme national groups.
thrilled to have @moelleithee join @thedemocrats as our comm director. his years of experience will be an invaluable asset.
had a great time talking with young democrats at the @nhdems headquarters yesterday. #goblue
great to see so many talented and inspirational women on this list:
love it rt @chairmanbuckley: accepting @dwstweets' #tbt challenge here is my high school photo from 37 years ago.
another disappointing move by @flgovscott. this time he's trying to take away voting rights &gt;
hey @flgovscott, "there is no evidence that non-citizens in florida are systematically voting."
retweet if you're a democratic woman who has thought about running for elected office. #fem2
#votingrightsmatter, they're fundamental to who we are as americans.
.@donnabrazile: "it's up to us to ensure voting isn't downgraded from a right to a privilege."
48 years ago, lbj signed into law the historic #vra. today, the fight continues:
this op-ed says it all. republicans would rather obstruct than govern:
"republicans, confronted with the responsibilities of governing, essentially threw a tantrum, then ran off to sulk."
happy 52nd birthday president obama! thanks for your great leadership for our country.
congratulations to @patrickgaspard, @thedemocrats amazing exec. director on his confirmation as ambassador to #southafrica! #felisitasyon!
.@bsfarrington congratulations!!
today's 40th vote to repeal #obamacare is just the latest in republican obstruction:
my message to @collegedems: you define what you can do, not your age. don't let others set limits to your success. #cda2013
if republicans focused on jobs instead of useless repeal votes, today's job report would be even better. #gopobstruction
while today's job numbers are encouraging, there's still more to do to get everyone who wants a job back to work.
gop = #sameoldparty with the same extreme agenda that hurts women and our economic security:
this attack isn't just against @wendydavistexas, it's against the thousands of texans who stood with her:
july was a banner month for gop outreach to women. see what they've been up to:
.@flgovscott owes every floridian an apology for his reckless and divisive policies. #votersuppression #ethics #womenshealth #thelistgoeson
proud of rep. @jim_moran. scathing speech re: house @gop massive cuts to energy/h2o approps bill-relentless attack on environment, economy.
as republicans obstruct progress, president obama is putting forth plans to grow america's middle class:
just talked about president obama's plan for job creation on @dailyrundown. here's the plan.
48 years later, democrats are still fighting to provide americans with affordable care and vital services:
there are so many important issues facing our country. it's time to stop the wasteful votes:
pat mccrory not only signed an extreme anti-choice bill into law, he broke his campaign promise by doing it:
holding our government hostage for political gain is so absurd that even r's are speaking out:
great piece from @donnabrazile on the 14th amendment and the importance of protecting #votingrights:
.@sierraclub this  great ad! snapped this at #bos. #sotrue #climatechange #environment #globalwarming
as we commemorate the anniversary of the korean war, please join me in thanking our veterans for their service and sacrifices.
.@taylorswift13 as a mom, i've admired your big heart. in #boston, try to see girl w/ leukemia missing u b/c of treatment. #taylormeetanna
note to the gop: we should be encouraging young people to vote, not making it harder:
president obama gets it: infrastructure projects aren't just good investments for the future, they create jobs today:
thanks to chris matthews for having me on @hardball today. it's time to end republican obstruction in washington.
more insensitive comments from a republican on women's health issues ---&gt;
there's no room for ideologues and extreme views when it comes to saving a woman's life:
.@stevekingia, you should  listen to your constituents and support #immigrationreform ---&gt;
my constituent michael is a finalist in the teens drive smart contest for "seatbelt swagger."
oy. yet another example of republicans trying to limit #votingrights:
.@joaquincastrotx finally settled his bet today. he even showed us how to properly unwrap a tamale. #goheat!
how can republicans embrace "grace, love and respect" while opposing equality for all americans?
had a good time campaigning for @terrymcauliffe last night. he's going to make a great governor! #vagov
stopped by a phone bank for @terrymcauliffe tonight. people are fired up! #vagov
what will they say next? the world's flat?
i still can't believe speaker boehner said this. we're elected to create laws, not obstruct the process:
americans want solutions, not more obstruction. when will republicans learn?
.@helenaguirrefer come on helen.you really think racial disparity in convictions, sentencing for same crimes mostly b/c of better lawyers?

yes, these are actual statements from republicans:
best of luck to @johnewalshdem. he's been a great leader for @massdems. thanks john.
the gop continues to push measures against the will of the people:
ripping food stamps from the farm bill is one of the most shameful acts republicans have ever taken:
.@wendydavistexas is right -- this fight is far from over:
after thousands protested, the tx gop still passed an extreme anti-choice bill. they should be ashamed.

try as he might, gomez cant run from the national gop or the fact that he would be a rubber stamp for their extreme agenda. #masen
today, house republicans passed the most extreme abortion legislation in the last decade:
today's vote shows once again that the well-being of women is not something republicans care about:
what you'll see in tonight's #masen debate: gomez trying to distract voters from his strong support of the national gop agenda.
when will the gop learn? women want to make their own health care decisions:
women shouldn't have to worry that our government will try to interfere in personal health care decisions.
the gop's abortion bill is an extreme, unprecedented reach into women's lives. #goprebrand

@deebeediva
just left the #hopeinstitute. loved meeting everyone. this is what democrats do. we invest in the next generation.
despite a so-called #goprebrand, republicans are still trying to force their extreme ideology on women:
republicans are at it again, proving that they are out of touch and extreme.
once again, tonight gabriel gomez showed he's out of step with the people of ma:
rt @thedemocrats: before you tune in to tonight's #masen #westernma debate, watch this video:
good news rt @thedemocrats: breaking: the senate just took a huge step and voted to move forward on #immigrationreform debate.
since the #equalpayact became law 50 years ago, we've continued to make strides toward women's pay equity.
excited to tune in tonight for the nba documentary on my childhood neighbor, dr. j. #goheat
to my colleagues who voted against common-sense gun reform, here's a reminder of why you should change your mind:
.@hillaryclinton's an inspiration. look forward to reading her twitter feed.
the #equalpay act was a big step forward, but we still have a long way to go in securing equal rights for women.
got home late last night after weekend of campaigning for @edmarkey for #masen. didn't have a chance to say #goheat! awesome win!
huge volunteer turnout for @edmarkey in springfield! #masen
as @vp joe biden rightfully explains, "this fight is far from over" on gun safety.
rt @thedemocrats: rt and sign this petition if you support common-sense reforms to reduce gun violence:

rt @edmarkey: fact check: gabriel gomez does not support universal background checks #masen #wbzglobedebate
.@edmarkey's the only candidate who stands with massachusetts families on the issues that matter most. #wbzglobedebate
women have legitimate questions about @gomezforma's stance on dangerous blunt amendment. why won't he answer them? #masen
rt @thedemocrats: allen west = extreme candidate who may make 2016 run. #goprebrand = looking worse and worse every day.
still can't believe an elected official tried to say raging hormones are an excuse for sexual assault. unbelievable:
.@joaquincastrotx will leave @tomas_regalado to take on your bro. care to wager @miamiheat v #sorryspurs? will put up joe's stone crab. you?
as a working mom, i'm offended by these comments. when is that #goprebrand supposed to happen again?

by voting against marriage equality today, republicans showed once again that they're the party of less inclusion and less opportunity.
if we want common-sense reforms to prevent gun violence, we need everyone to speak out. add your voice today:
republicans need media specialists to teach them "how to say what we mean and show that we care."

gop decided it was better to slash vital services for #middleclass and seniors than close tax loopholes for wealthy.
great job by my colleague @repadamschiff on @cnn boiling down #sequester. @gop choosing wealthy tax loopholes over protecting #middleclass.
@thedougw @repdwstweets no change. @repdwstweets is my #fl23 account.
gop leadership refuses to come together with dem. leadership to try to avoid the sequester's damaging effects. truly the #gopsequester.
this women's history month, remember: we can't stop now. our work isn't done in the fight for equality and opportunity.
there's still time. tell congress: put the middle class ahead of corporate-jet owners and #stopthesequester.
why aren't republican leaders in congress listening to the american people? why aren't they sitting down with dems to #stopthesequester?
the american people support a balanced mix of spending cuts and closing tax loopholes that protect the wealthiest. #stopthesequester
worth a retweetthe devastating effects of the sequester in one chart:
we have a president who's fighting for the right of all people to marry, no matter who they love. get his back:
you know, has anyone told the oscars people that there are families watching their show with their kids? #apparentlynot
my husband (who has a beard) just asked the same thing./rt @thetinabeast: why does everyone have a beard? #oscars

rt @michelleobama: an open letter from the first lady to parents on talking to your kids about newtown:
nra press conf. appalling in its insensitivity to #newtown parents and families and every parent in america clutching our hearts the past week.
rt @pfeiffer44: infographic: republican plan b cuts taxes for the wealthy, while middle class foots the bill
the american people want a balanced approach that protects the middle class and asks the wealthy to pay their sharetime for gop to listen.
gop's #planb boils down to tax cuts for millionaires, tax hikes for the middle class, and no solutions for our long-term fiscal challenges.
sen. inouye's humble spirit and dedicated service to the aloha state and to all americans will not soon be forgotten.
watched pres. obama's speech as a family. gut-wrenching reassuring our 9 yr old she shouldn't worry this will happen @ her school. #newtown
whether they witness a tragedy, see it on tv or hear adults talking, tips for talking to kids about tragedy
its a parents nightmare that they send their child to school and they not return. my thoughts and prayers are w the families as they grieve.

romney and ryan, mourdock and akin are two sets of twins when it comes to women's health issues.
getting out the vote in little havana -- fl knows better than anyone that we have to make this a no-regrets election.
couldn't resist taking the #gottavote bus for a quick stop at bob roth's new river groves in davie. #flhomegrown #yum
had a great time talking with my constituents last night at olympus in hallandale beach.
if you think it's unacceptable that mitt romney's endorsement of richard mourdock is still on the air, add your name:
with only 13 days left, it's great to see the ofa office in riviera beach, florida, packed with volunteers.
florida's fired up to vote early for @barackobama. find out if early voting is in your state at
richard mourdock said pregnancy from rape is what "god intended." guess who his most prominent booster is? mitt romney.
richard mourdocks rape comments are outrageous and demeaning to women, and romney should immediately denounce them.
kicked off an early vote gotv dorm storm at ucf in orlando tonight. two weeks out, the knights are ready to go!
great t-shirt sighting in st. pete -- this year, we're voting for our moms, our sisters, and our daughters.
there's no quit in america. we have a president who understands thatand who has a plan to keep us moving forward.
@chucktodd a tad too nitpicky chuck-locals often refer to delray beach as delray in shorthand.
mitt romney failed the commander in chief test tonight.
a big thank you to all of the volunteers whose hard work made each of these debates a success.
clear picture of mitt romney's priorities as commander in chief: he failed to mention our veterans once tonight. #romneynotready
#proudofobama tonightlet's make sure he's our commander in chief for four more years.
.@mittromney thinks that "china wants the world to be free". #newstothechinese #lynn
.@jbendery @johnkerry that's because none were prepared for him in advance like the binders full of women were in mass. #lynndebate #binders
"when i went to israel, i didnt take donors," says obama to romney. "i didnt have fundraisers. i went to yad vashem."
president obama is clear: as long as i am president, iran will not get a nuclear weapon. #strongerwithobama
someone needs to tell @mittromney that "me too" is not leadership. we already have @barackobama leading the way. #notready #lynndebate
president obama says egypts peace treaty with israel is a red line for us, vital to u.s. interests and our allys security.
president obama: israel "is a true friend and our greatest ally in the region." #strongerwithobama
.@mittromney cares about the u.s.-israel relationship so much he didn't mention israel once during entire exchange on middle east. #hollow
mitt romney called it "tragic" to end the war in iraq. on foreign policy, the choice is clear. #romneynotready
great talking to south florida seniors today with my former colleague in congress and chicago's mayor, @rahmemanuel.
the rncs decision to continue to employ a firm with a well-known history of registration fraud is unconscionable.
today we lost a leader. sen. mcgovern's lifelong commitment to serving our country was an inspiration to so many of us.

daytona beach doesn't want any part of romney-ryan's sketchy deal for women and the middle class.
what we have seen throughout this election cycle is a concerted effort by the rnc and its allies to win the game by rigging it altogether.
the rnc has now been implicated or alleged to have been involved in voter reg fraud in virginia, colorado and my home state of florida.
a little rain didn't stop jacksonville, nc, from coming out to see the #gottavote bus. this city is #firedup.

rt @thedemocrats: at tonight's debate, mitt romney said he had "binders full of women." we found one:
#romneyexposed once again that all he has to offer are false attacks, empty proposals and failed leadership.
mitt romney lost, launching one misfire after another in his attacks against the president and missing the mark on his own proposals.
president obama is the clear victor tonight. he made it clear he possesses the strength, decisiveness and steady hand our country needs.
libya question left #romneyexposed as a candidate who is not in command of the factsor foreign policy.
so did president bush and we saw how that worked out./rt @ananavarro: romney just promised to do immigration reform in his 1st year. wow!
the #realromney's immigration plan: self-deportation, veto the dream act.
rt @messina2012: romney openly dishonest on contraception.  it is called the blunt amendment and romney supports it. #sketchydeal
only one candidate on stage stands up for women and equal pay: first bill @barackobama signed was lilly ledbetter fair pay act.
#realromney on taxes:
.@lireport loved speaking to this smart young timeforkids reporter! asked great questions, showed she was prepared! #betshemadehermomproud
mitt romney's playing a dangerous game with the american people -- and it's called mittnopoly.
romney has avoided saying how he'd pay for $5 trillion tax cutsbut now, the details are a click away.

tonights debate showed two approaches to facts and details: vp @joebiden understands they matterrep. ryan does not.
@joebiden showed us why @barackobama chose him as vp. had facts, experience, gravitas-@paulryanvp chose deception over details. #factsmatter
rep. paul ryan has cast a whopping 60 anti-choice votes in the house of representatives. #detailsmatter #womenforobama

mitt romney blatantly lied at last night's debate. he might have impressed pundits, but he lost on facts. fight back:
you're welcome! thanks for having my back!/mt@alan4florida: now that was quick..... @dwstweets @alan4florida
tonight, @barackobama laid out his vision for continuing to move america forward with an economy that grows from the middle out.
mitt romney might "love great schools," but his budget could cut $115 billion+ from the department of education over a decade.
i have a pre-existing condition. mitt romney would let insurance companies deny millions of americans like me coverage.
obamacare strengthens medicare. period.
unbelievable to hear mitt romney defend oil subsidies. #forwardnotback

message for our troops and veterans.
rep. @janschakowsky, @sandrafluke and i are speaking up for women: romney and ryan are out of step with our rights.
romney's massachusetts record is proof: he doesn't know the first thing about job creationat least not how to create jobs in america.
i'm in tampa to talk about what romney won't: his record as ma governor, where he ranked 47 out of 50 in job creation.
all we heard tonight from paul ryan: false attack after false attack, vitriol, and not a single idea for moving our country forward.
proud to speak out about why romney and ryan are dangerously wrong for women with fellow #womenforobama in milwaukee.

getting ready to talk about the gop's dangerously wrong policies for women. tune into @piersmorgan on cnn at 9:15 et

getting ready to talk taxes on @mitchellreportstune into msnbc now.
@susannahfl thank you,my friend!
romney-ryan present a threat to seniors' earned benefits. last thing we should do is put retirement security at risk.

while romney campaigns in florida, i'll be on @wolfblitzercnn at 5:35 talking about why he and paul ryan would be a disaster for our state.
paul ryan is notably absent here in florida today. no wonder: seniors want nothing to do with #romneyryaneconomics.
spoke to cnn's @soledad_obrien about the #romneyryaneconomics bus
tour from our first stop today in miami gardens.
we're organizing for our kids' future -- this is a great snapshot of why this election matters:
spreading the word in my home state, fl: #romneyryaneconomics would throw seniors and the middle class under the bus.
clearly priorities usa is a democratic superpac. was trying to state the obvious: we have no control over their activities.
in studio on @foxnewssunday talking about why #romneyryan2012 would be a disaster for america's seniors.
firing up the crowd at workers stand for america rally in pa. america's workers stand firmly behind president obama.
paul ryan, like mitt romney, has seriously flawed ideas for our economy that have only failed us in the past.
rt @barackobama: read and rt: what you (and your friends) need to know about paul ryan.
talking to reporters @ofa_ia about why romney's wrong for iowa,   including his plan to end the wind-energy tax credit
proud to address @iowademocrats at tonight's north iowa wing ding dinner.
romney would let wind tax credit expire. rt @ofa_ia: check out how president obama is keeping wind power jobs in iowa -
rt if you agree:
how much will mitt romney's middle-class tax hike cost you? you'll be surprised.
we must continue to ensure all eligible americans have the opportunity for their voices to be heard and ballots counted.
today we remember the sacrifices of the americans who gave so muchin some cases their livesto secure and protect the right to vote.
romney owes us more than tax returnshe owes the american people answers about why he invested and sent jobs overseas.

new york deli reception with my friend dccc chairman @repsteveisrael. my kind of party!
mitt romney's tax plan boils down to this: he pays less, you pay more.
my former #gop fl house colleague @senrenegarcia testifies @ house judiciary mtg against harmful, divisive gop #englishonly bill #principles
change delivered: insurers start covering preventive care like birth control copay-free. #thanksobamacare #women4obama
went on @politicsnation to talk about what @thedemocrats are doing to
protect the vote.
stopped by #obama2012 hq to meet the hardworking organizers who are going to win this election for @barackobama.
outside groups are pouring millions in to drag down @thedemocrats and @barackobama. help us close the fundraising gap:
mt @thedemocrats: the drafting committee for @demconvention embraced marriage equality as part of our 2012 platform.
sign that @mittromney's foreign trip didn't go well? press sec'y curses @ press for having nerve to ask romney questions. #professional
@urstadt @westavenuesobe @popogigi1 @michaelgongora so good to meet u all too! great talking about how we can work together for #miamibeach!
president obama and @thedemocrats are fighting every day to defend the fundamental promise of medicare and medicaid.

the #affordablecareact bringing #health care costs down! thanks to byagman for pic of your dad's #aca rebate letter.
gallup confirms it: the jewish community is standing strongly behind @barackobama over mitt romney68% to 25%.
romney supports a budget that would end #medicare as we know it -- risking coverage for 221,000 nh residents.
democrats in portsmouth, nh, know what's at stake in this election: #medicare, which marks 47 years on monday.
we've come a long way thanks to the americans with disabilities actbut there's more to do. get involved in #obama2012:

@cdoolz13 here's a link to my intern program page
everything romney told you about not being there when his firm was helping outsource jobs? wasn't true.
mitt romney hasn't been telling us the truth about when he left his job at bain. zero credibility.
all we need to know: @mittromney says, "believe in america", but invest your $ in switzerland, bermuda and the caymans!
looking #forward to being "on the hill" w/ nt'l conf. of black state legislators today and my friends @alan4florida  and sen. arthenia joyner!
the american people deserve better from mitt romney than "just take our word for it."

@repdonnaedwards @edshow @thereval my bank is just past my kid's pediatrician and the drug store. #wheresyourbank? @melaniednc @woodhouseb
why does @mittromney have secret offshore accts? he should follow his own father's lead and #comeclean. release multiple years of tax returns.
mitt romney's lack of transparency is unacceptable for a presidential candidate.
.@mittromney spox: romney hasn't paid "a penny less in taxes"for secret offshore accts. says him! must release more tax returns. #comeclean

proud to campaign for a president who stands up for marriage equality.
with #lgbt2012 in orlando:
we need more women like these orlandoans running for office. so thrilled to offer them my advice. #women2012
while @barackobama has led on the issue, romney called az law a model for the nation and refuses to take position on scotus ruling. #weak
i share @barackobama's concern on provision scotus upheld. no one should live under cloud of suspicion because of what they look like.
pleased scotus struck down much of flawed az law. republicans in congress should stop playing politics and work with @barackobama on reform.

were you in chorus?/mt@alispiegs: love looking at work that @dwstweets has done-remembering i was @ her inauguration in 5th grade #progress
bottom line: choice, affordable contraception, and planned parenthood are at stake in this election.
disappointed in @hilaryr 's comments. as a mother of 3 theres no doubt that raising children is work.
if he had been president in 2009, would romney have signed lilly ledbetter? #wellgetbacktoyouonthat
voters deserve to know: if a bill to repeal lilly ledbetter act were in front of romney, would he veto or sign it? #wellgetbacktoyouonthat
the women i met in pa are upset by the gop's attacks on their rightsbut they're also fired up and ready to organize.
if he is for equal pay for women, @mittromney's camp should be able to say w/o asking if he supports lily ledbetter fair pay law! #nobrainer
thanks to @paulcastronovo, youngron & @paulandyoungron show for talking up my small biz workshop!
romney camp pushing debunked claim that potus set unemployment benchmark. he didn't. but we've added 4 million private-sector jobsprogress.
join me in sending a warm twitter welcome to @joebiden!
wishing a happy easter to everyone celebrating today.
to all who will begin celebrating passover tonight, chag semeach. i wish you a wonderful seder with family and friends.
by repealing wi's equal pay law, gov. walker is turning back the clock on women's rights in the workplace. shameful.
there's still work ahead on the road to recovery, but 4 million+ private-sector jobs over 25 straight months of job growth is #progress.
why did @mittromney leave off his $1.5 million investment in iran oil on his 2010 tax return? #whatsromneyhiding
rep. schwartz and i are in the city of brotherly love with a simple
message: the gop has no love for our sisters.
pa women, led by rep. schwartz, know attacks on our rights are not fictionand they'll make sure the gop gets the msg
there is nothing fictitious about the gop and mitt romneys anti-women agenda, & no amount of dismissive statements can change the facts.
@shotwave well, thank you very much! that is nice of you to say.
latest evidence that gop is out of touch with women: @reincepriebus thinks gop attacks on women as fictional as "war on caterpillars."
analogies not workin' for @reincepriebus. women's health=caterpillars? compared @barackobama to italian ship tragedy.
@buzzfeedben etch-a-sketch/verbal distance won't help @mittromney shake full embrace of house gop/teaparty extremism. #hecanrunbuthecanthide
so excited to be at inaugural game w/ my family at @marlins park! new stadium is incredible! #gomarlins!
romney has significantly more work to do before he can become the gop nominee, and he's doing incredible damage to himself along the way.
love meeting volunteers like the @ofa_mo team as they organize across st.
louis & lay the groundwork for victory.
it's no wonder american women stand with president obamawe know how out of touch romney & the gop are with our values.

stories like these make me proud to be a democrat:
romney and his allies may have bought their way to another victory tonight in illinois, but it comes at a heavy price:
romney adviser's idea of a "fiscal solution" is "deporting seniors...to lower ss and medicare costs." gop has no ideas, just offensive jokes.
help @thedemocrats tell the gop and insurance companies that being a woman is not a pre-existing condition. share this:
.@evalongoria great to join you for "dinner w/ eva" tonight w/ our 5 fantastic @barackobama supporters! #happybirthday
on this 9th iraq war anniversary, let's honor all who've worn our nation's uniformand a president who kept his promise to end the war.
rt @thedemocrats gop candidates would put health insurers back in chargekeeping gender discrimination in place. video:
in 2014, thanks to the affordable care act, being a woman will no longer be considered a pre-existing condition.
the news that women pay more than men for the same health insurance is further proof that president obamas health reform is so important.

if you're outraged about romney's vow to "get rid of" planned parenthood, stand w/ @thedemocrats as we stand for women:
romney thinks tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires are the priority over cervical cancer screenings and mammograms:
romney did everything he could to pander to the far right wing of his party, like shamefully vowing to "get rid of" planned parenthood.
wasnt for a lack of tryingromney had a huge spending advantage over his rivals, which he used to carpet-bomb them with negative ads.
romney simply cannot close the deal with republican primary voters, who handed him losses in both alabama and mississippi tonight.
congratulations to davie (fl) mayor judy paul on your tremendous victory tonight! i was proud to support you! #winninginhorsecountry

romney cant run from the truth: he's repeatedly expressed support for a national individual health care mandate.
rnc chair @reincepriebus thinks the job situation "is not improving." he should check out this infographic:
@reincepriebus your statement, first thing this a.m. "...the situation is clearly not improving." trying to backtrack? #canthaveitbothways

it was a particularly bad #supertuesday for romney, who once again failed to close the dealdespite millions spent.
the muddled mess that is the gop primary continues tonight as unenthusiastic r voters failed to rally around a candidate. #supertuesday

my friend @daroff & i @ #aipac2012 policy conf. thank you for coming to @thedemocrats reception!
all @mittromney had to say re @rushlimbaugh's slut remark on #sandrafluke was "...not words i would have chosen." women voters, take notice!

my @meetthepress interview on mitt romney, rush limbaugh, and the gop's war on women:
proud to stand with @barackobama, who delivered a strong #aipac speechand reaffirmed his commitment to our greatest ally & their security.
here's a peek behind the scenes at this morning's @meetthepress:
romney managed a victory in #wacaucus, but his pandering is undermining the key support he'll need if he's the nominee.
#standwithsandra and everyone else who's fighting for women's health in the face of gop attack:

honoring the contributions of millions of american mothers, sisters & daughters this #womenshistorymonth:
while president obama has been fighting to create jobs, gop has been at war with women and their access to health care.
good news for women. rt @thedemocrats: the senate votes to table the extreme, anti-women's health blunt-rubio amendment in a 5148 vote.
here's what's at stake for millions of women if the latest romney-endorsed gop attack on our health passes:
this is important: before the senate votes today, stand up for a woman's right to make decisions about her own health.
rt @thedemocrats: today, romneyafter a quick flip-flopofficially joined gop's latest attack against women's health.
behind the scenes at my @mitchellreports appearance this afternoon:
i'll be joining @mitchellreports at 1:15pm et.  tune in to @msnbctv to watch live.
no surprise that romney is quickly becoming the most unpopular potential general election nominee in history.
in #az, romney confirmed that hed be the most extreme nominee in recent history on immigration.
in #mi, romney had to double down on his incredibly out-of-touch position that we should have "let detroit go bankrupt."
the majority of #mi voters chose #anybodybutromney today in his home state. the more they get to know @mittromney the less they like him.
gee, do you think @mittromney should be winning his home state by more than 30k votes? outspent @ricksantorum 2:1 & won #mi by 10 pts in '08
team effort on ft laud wave streetcar w/ rep hastings @kristin_jacobs @jackseiler, dda. thanks to fta_dot admin rogoff!
just saw @msnbctv @tamronhall's new #leanforward promo on patriotism and growing up in a military family. "our troops not red or blue."
increased fuel efficiency standards for us cars pushed thru by @barackobama will reduce need for oil by 2m barrels/year. #alloftheabove
@barackobama "anyone who says we can drill our way out of problem doesn't know what they're talking about." us-2% of world oil reserves.
#outoftouch: gop candidates mentioned word "jobs" only 10 times in 2 hrs. @ricksantorum uttered word 0 times #cnndebate
heading to the studio in fl to join @jansingco this morning.  tune in to @msnbctv at 10:00am et.
choice is clear: the president will move america forward. the gop would be bad news for our economy.
all the gop candidates had to offer during tonights debate were more shameless attempts to woo the extreme right wing. #cnndebate
1 question after tonite's #cnndebate: do gop candidates have any proposals to create jobs? seem to live in alternate universe of extremism.
follow along! rt @thedemocrats: stay tuned: we're fact checking the gop candidates in tonight's #cnndebate at

the more voters learn about romney's extreme, out-of-touch positions, the less they like him or trust him to lead.
that's because romney will say anything, take any position, and will distort any fact about his or his opponents' record to win.
with every passing gop contest, romney becomes weaker with key general election swing and independent votersshould he make it that far.
@mccormackjohn sorry abt that john! call @woodhouseb if you'd like to follow-up w/ me-hear u may have some great stories when u were his ra!

yes @sptvrock i agree. as @ra_thore knows, my comment to him was tongue-in-cheek. but alas, bjp followers have no sense of humour.
@akkoomohan i think i need more details of what you promised andwhat u need
@123amman thanks. it was a genuine pleasure. the dps kids were impressive and the setting splendid.
@pnrazdan it's been reported pretty fully in the two kashmiri papers i saw today, greater kashmir and the reader. will upload a text soon
@camelotemperor @aqpk kashmiri pandits have always been there! and india permits no settlers, nor can non-kashmiris acquire property in jandk
@therohitbansal @sptvrock it was. i was certainly more inspired. the kids were amazing andasked intelligent, probing questions too.

@indian_mum @nithinrao why would anyone professing a tolerant faith justify his bigotry with reference to the bigotry of others?

@bhatesc i have written about 1984 in detail in 2 well-received books, india from midnight to the millennium (1997) and riot (2001)
@semsjc no, it's not. the law of the land is clear: minimum age for marriage is 18 for girls, 21 for boys
in #indiafrommidnighttothemillennium (1997) i have explained in detail why i prefer my own hindu faith to those that claim2be the onlytruth
hindutva literally means hinduness. its ethos infuses india. but political hindutva is a 20th century project built on bigotryandintolerance.
political hindutva, asserting the cultural superiorirty of one religion,is the antithesis of hinduism, which preaches toleranceanduniversalism
recalling vivekananda's immortal chicago speech, a rebuke to advocates of hindutva andother religious bigotry:
