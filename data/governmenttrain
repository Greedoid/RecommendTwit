mitchell: maven was approved 5 years ago. we won't consider it successful until it's on orbit and collecting data!
jakosky: maven will launch in three weeks and take nearly a year to arrive in mars orbit. we're excited to be here!
jakosky: maven has eight science instruments on board and a communications module to talk to the rovers.
may: the maven team has done a stellar job preparing the spacecraft for launch! on orbit, it will provide great data!
green: maven will tell us why mars went through the such dramatic atmospheric changes over the years!
grunsfeld: maven will help determine mars atmosphere. the team did a great job preventing delays from the shutdown.
