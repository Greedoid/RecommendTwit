@ismaellgarcia acceptance is the key to be, to be truly free. #letthelightin
@milegendz because it's my favorite one on the record and the message is so universal but diverse about the subject of love.

mariah carey, prince and wendy and lisa! oh, and ya know  @katyspad: @katyperry who inspired birthday ;)
@xcallmechrissyx i feel like it represents so many different sides of me but is the most lyrically dense/vulnerable record i've made so far.

september is pediatric cancer month. gold is its color. isabel song is a true inspiration. read her story:

so.... @teganandsara just came out and surprised the crowd with 'closer' and made an entire sold out staples crowd dance. unreal!!!
i think it's important to note that @cherlloyd and i are actually both in mid-air in this picture.
to everyone who came to the show tonight in la, i adore you. to anyone coming to the next 3 shows, expect more of the unexpected :)
one of my favorite moments of the night was @cherlloyd coming out to sing 'want u back'. the crowd went insane!! and she's such a fun girl!

my dancing shoes are on. why, you ask? paramore and new found glory! nashville!! scream!!
i think i'm going to go rearrange my refrigerator magnets now.
had international interviews all day. now i'm sitting on a rocking chair on my balcony watching vanderbilt college kids move into dorms.
me: hey mom, i gotta go running. talk to you later. mom: alright. be careful. me: i'm running on a treadmill. mom: still. just.. be careful.
my dad likes to randomly hide guitar picks in my house when he comes to visit. just found another stash. in the silverware drawer.
good one, dad. hahaha
puttering around my place, reading cookbooks and celebrating the fact that i'm no longer scared of the sound of my ice maker at night.
i landed in japan and got 20 texts and looked at itunes and got tears in my eyes. and so, we begin again. :) 
saw the cutest movie last night. cried like 4 times. plus, check out the theater number..
as i suspected! paul mccartney is charming and endearing in person.
her response: "nah you pretty much just dance like an idiot in general. with me. at parties. by ourselves."
texting caitlin from the next room to say goodnight: "night, sis. i don't dance like an idiot like that with anyone else."
antique shopping with @grantmickelson before the web chat today.
i like it when it's the 13th.
dear whoever is renting out a loft that @elizabethhuett wants to look at, please email her back so she'll stop talking about it nonstop. xo
went antique shopping with my parents in downtown franklin. bought a compass and a knitted cat pillow. both very necessary for my new place.

sitting on a porch with @clairecallaway2 @elizabethhuett @grantmickelson eating bbq, discussing american history.

driving-- had my ipod on shuffle, then decided to just listen to @owlcity. suddenly it's a daydreamy day in nashville.
@amosjheller is slaying a bass part in the studio right now.

liz: wanna go to h&m with me?! caitlin: nah, i was thinking of heading to the lincoln memorial. liz: thanks for making me feel shallow.

our first headlining stadium show. tiger stadium, baton rouge... i had the time of my life with you tonight.
just soundchecked in a beautiful, massive, vast stadium! all band members and i could be found taking pictures on the stage like tourists.
one of the first episodes of the oc is on in my hotel room in canada. i feel suddenly compelled to buy the entire first season on dvd.
how to make wednesday night in an la hotel room suddenly feel like home. 
i've been eating cheerios like it's my job lately.
the band and i are in a 15-passenger van, geeking out over the @butchwalker and the black widows show, listing our favorite parts. eeeee!!!
fell in love with the st. paul crowd, then saw the coolest show ever. @butchwalker is the best performer i've ever seen. hands down.
sitting in my hotel room in nyc. just saw a commercial on tv for letters to juliet and was like thats my song in the background. to myself.
this ones called 'best man cat'. (@elizabethhuett and @grantmickelson )
new app: catpaint. it will change your life.
please keep nashville in your heart. seeing a picture of the grande ole opry halfway underwater was a kind of heartbreak i can't describe.
a first for me tonight: trimming my bangs backstage in the quick change room in between songs. 
gotta love @clairecallaway2.
claire just walked in and said "i really hope my daddy wins the barbecue contest today. by the way yall, today is tim mcgraw's birthday."
i'm pretty sure all of the woodland creatures of hendersonville had a meeting and decided tonight they would all run out in front of my car.

omg right now. the mayor of fresno just gave me the official document proclaiming today "taylor swift day" in fresno! i feel like i belong!
one of my favorite moments is when my dad points to caitlin's nose ring and says "you got a little something there.." every. time.
i rode an elevator with a guy who was whistling the tune of 'this is the song that never ends'. putting that on me? come on dude..
today i painted "eas" on one side of my face and "ter!" on the other. and cooked all day. the lake looked beautiful.

trying to find a @needtobreathe concert close to one of our tour dates-- dying to see their show!
last week, i challenged these guys to help an old lady cross the street. never expected this level of greatness!
the other day this guy came up to me and said "long live butch walker!!". then we high-fived. it was the coolest.
the downside to drawing my lucky number on my hand = waking up with an upside down 13 imprint on the side of my face.
"wow, that walk was windy. i felt like chewbacca there for a second." -my mom
wearing glasses today, so i can look a little more like @xchadballx.. because it's his birthday!! i miss you and @yelyahwilliams!
wearing glasses today, so i can look a little more like @xchadballx.. because it's his birthday!! i miss you and @yelyahwilliams!
riveting.
code red in the dressing room. 30 minutes to show, liz lost her teasing comb, then borrowed caitlin's. then broke it. then found hers.
after a day of roller coasters and joy, watching lifetime on the bus. this movie called no reservations. abigail breslin is seriously great.
getting ready in my room, singing my thoughts. super annoying new habit of mine. today it's "i love acm nominations i love acm nominations".
at the nail salon. toes under the nail-dryer thing. they put me in front of the bowl of tootsie rolls. now they're having to refill it.
new video blog, so... :)
when discussing adding 'today was a fairytale' to the set, mike (banjo) suggested that we only play it if that day actually was a fairytale.
management meeting. we got a giant new conference room table. my mom and my manager are talking on walkie talkies from opposite ends of it.

about to go onstage in tokyo. it just got way sentimental in the dressing room with @caitlinbird and @elizabethhuett. i love doing this.
japan is amazing. japan is amazing. japan is amazing.
tonight the band and i played a show, then hopped in the van and headed to the park for some midnight wild possum feeding.
@caitlinbird has just pointed out the coincidence involved in getting stuck in our own concert traffic.
we just planned on dinner, but it turned into barefoot beach frolicking in melbourne tonight. took pictures of my friends. will post.
conducting a social experiment in catering to see if blowing bubbles makes people smile. results pending.
playing with glittery eyeliner in the dressing room while @elizabethhuett and i discuss how caramel tim tams have changed our lives.
sydney, australia.. you just stole my heart.
i will remember this night, this celebration, the screaming and hugging of people i love. the words on cards of hotel room good luck roses..
on the way to staples center for grammy rehearsals. there are 13 letters in 'staples center'.
"i'd hug you right now but... you're really sparkly and i know stuff would fall off." -@caitlinbird
@xchadballx get well soon, @grantmickelson and i love and miss you!!
i didn't notice until now that the person who made my coffee today wrote 'you're wonderful' on the cup. it made my day.
early morning video shoot with the whole band! @caitlinbird and i swear we saw it snow for a second. staring out the window like children.
slept on the plane in a pile of @caitlinbird and @elizabethhuett. now i feel sort of like a crumpled up shirt.
brit award nomination? what??!!! eeeeee!!!
@grantmickelson that is beautiful.
listening to @owlcity and @breanneduren's sweet voices. 'tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in loooove? (all the time..all the time..)'
the hardest part about motivating myself to run is finding matching socks.
at the end of 'decode', there are siren sounds, causing me to look around for the five-oh every time i'm driving blasting it. thanks hayley!
andddd a link to the photo blog that works:
it's the 13th today. did you know that?
more recording. so excited. so excited. so excited. see, i said that three times. once for every album we've made in this studio.
mom: "today i chipped my tooth." austin: "what happened, you get curb-stomped?"
my mom's bday party was yesterday. my aunt mistakenly referred to def leppard's 'photograph' as 'autograph'. a few times. family time!!
i am riding in a helicopter right now. and i have service up here! heading to the peoples choice awards. mid-air tweeting... so 2010.
sorry to @grantmickelson for, after having a dream where you were bitten by a shark, calling at 4am to make you swear to stay on land.
listening to my brother try to convince my mom to let him set the christmas tree on fire in the back yard. he's making a good case so far.
@juliannehough thought she could put out a dance aerobics dvd without me making her do the whole thing with me when we hang out. psshh..
just leaving @yelyahwilliams' surprise bday party with @grantmickelson. roller skates were worn, hanson was played. party! go hayley!
seeing 13's everywhere for the past few days. and 31's. which is 13 reversed. which totally still counts.
the last christmas with all of us under one roof, how weird is that? merry christmas to you guys, hug your families.
i was writing a song and my pen fell into the piano. still trying to figure out if i should do anything about this.
austin applied early to notre dame and just got his acceptance letter!! much jumping up and down and screaming ensued. party!!
just found my old life-size brad paisley cardboard cutout. or better yet.. it found me.
i'm twenty.
tonight was one of those nights you don't ever forget the details of. every little thing was shiny. jingle ball. what a way to end the year.
in furniture-browsing conversation, @caitlinbird just said "oh yeah, i saw that on the youtube". the unnecessary 'the' made me chuckle.
at the fancy hotel, i may have broken the fancy curtains because i didn't know they have a fancy electric button you push to close them. hm.
photo shoot all day, followed by dinner with emma stone. then we wandered around a candy store like wide-eyed little kids.
@brian_mansfield your playlist is amazing! already obsessed with civil wars, john, 5 for fighting, and butch. great suggestions.
this made me smile. :) :) :)
kiis-fm jingle ball was so much fun, that crowd just blew our minds! i love la crowds. and christmas ornament-themed-concerts.
@carterjenkins i'm playing tonight, see you there?
standout moment of my day: my business manager and i are going over policies and structure. his ringtone goes off: 'rockstar' by nickelback.
just went to a giant tent to pick out our christmas tree. brought back fond memories of my homeland. good times on the christmas tree farm..
driving around with abigail just like when we were 16. 'fifteen' just came on the car radio.

out on the lake with the band, trying my best to resist the burning temptation to scream "i'm on a boat".
i just impulsively bought my cat a shirt that says "hottie". i have no idea why. maybe i shouldn't have days off.
favorite lyric today: "i am what you see. i am not what they say. but if i turned out to be, could you love me anyway?" -tyler hilton
the dateline hour special on my tour airs tomorrow night at 7:00 (eastern). on nbc. watch it?
mute. done. ok. silence. i'm good.
the symphony music has just become a loud choral arrangement. i can't take this any longer. i guess i'm going to have to.. get up...

can't sleep because i'm not far away in a strange place. the comfort of bring home is actually keeping me up.

just played the paul o'grady show. what a genuine person and a pleasure to talk to. the weather in london is beautiful today.
trying to turn off the lights with my mind is not working. it appears i might actually have to get up and physically turn them off. lame.

most popular question today: "didn't your record just come out?"
studio. because i'm addicted to recording.
i'm staring at the "master remote control" for my hotel room. there are so many buttons. i just turned on the radio. without meaning to.

@ssaraaa thanks for believing in my rap skills. it's greatly appreciated. :)
@david_henrie the sad thing is that i thought of like 6 other ways to rhyme your name with things. yes, my love of rhymes can be a curse.

a day off in sydney. drove two hours out of the city and spent the day on the beach. wrote a chorus you'll hear on the next record. :)

brightest morning star is a song @sia helped me write about god :) who is ur brightest morning star? #britneyjeanlisteningparty
@dangerbritney that's what i hoped for! #britneyjeanlisteningparty
@buzzfeed chillin' with you ;)
he suggested getting foster the people 2 help on production. i really think they nailed it. they added a few bells and the whistle on the song
when @iamwill and i were finishing the song we felt it was missing something. it felt like it needed something to make the song more unique...
funny story about that! rt @emreakn i love the whistle in the beginning. it gives me chills. and the lyrics are soo emotional :(
this one was very therapeutic for me. sometimes a girl needs to remind herself not to cry and that life will go on.
really proud of the final version of #dontcry :) #britneyjeanlisteningparty
@grantpyoung @jamielynnspears i have too! it finally felt right for this album. #britneyjeanlisteningparty
@robin_h00d good luck!! thanks for tweeting along :) #britneyjeanlisteningparty

so much love to @sia for helping create such an amazing song!! xo #britneyjeanlisteningparty
@tiffanycarterxo lips are sealed :) #britneyjeanlisteningparty

#perfume is really just about relationship insecurities and feeling insecure about the person you care for the most #britneyjeanlisteningparty
